# imitation learning in multi-agent settings
Here we show how you could map a multi-agent pettingzoo environment to a gymnasium so we can imitate demonstrated behavior with GAIL.

## Setup
The project is a PyCharm project. To import, simply clone the repository from PyCharm and install the dependancies.

Otherwise: 
  - clone the project
  - navigate to /sa_simple_spread
  - "pip install ."

To run the imitation process, run learn_in_sa_simple_spread.py
To visualise the generated policies, run jointpolicy_visu_pettingzoo.py

# Videos
To watch the recorded videos of the imitation process, navigate to /videos and download the mp4-files.
